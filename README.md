# StepMania .ssc files extractor project

## Used technologies:
**C++, MySQL, Power BI**

## Description:
In this project, I used my own custom packs created for the game StepMania.

The program, written in C++, extracts all necessary information from .ssc files to a ChartsData.txt and NotesData.txt files.
An .ssc file is used in the rhythm game StepMania; in short, each individual file stores all information about a song and its corresponding chart.

In the SQL folder, you will find .csv files that were converted from .txt files generated by the C++ program. These tables were then processed in SQL (Data Cleaning), and I added several interesting queries for analysis. Finally, the cleaned data was visualized in Power BI (see the Power BI visualization folder).

## How does it work?
To make the extraction program work:
- you need to place sample StepMania packs containing .ssc files into the Packs folder: bin -> x64 -> Debug -> Packs -> example pack 1 -> song folder -> (this is where the .ssc file is located)
- run the "StepMania .ssc files extractor.exe" and follow the instructions: bin -> x64 -> Debug folder
- data will be saved in ChartsData.txt and NotesData.txt for future data cleaning and analysis!

# Folders structure:
- SQL Folder – .csv tables, data cleaning scripts, and SQL queries
- PowerBI visualization Folder – visualizations and example screenshots
